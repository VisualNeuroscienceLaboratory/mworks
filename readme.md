# How to work with this repository: #

Know that this is NOT the main MWorks repository. We (as in the VNL) have created our own fork on 7/24/15.

## You will need: ##

    A GitHub account which is linked to the VisualNeuroscienceLaboratory account (specifically for the mworks team; talk to Romesh, hopefully he's still here when you're reading this!).

    A copy of GitHub desktop

    A code editor

    MWServer, MWClient, MWEditor installed
