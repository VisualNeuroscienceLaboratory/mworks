## You will need: ##

* A GitHub account which is linked to the VisualNeuroscienceLaboratory account (specifically for the mworks team; talk to Romesh, hopefully he's still here when you're reading this!).

* A copy of GitHub desktop

* A code editor

* MWServer, MWClient, MWEditor installed

### How to sync your repository: ###

Just click the "Sync" button at the top right of the GitHub desktop program.
